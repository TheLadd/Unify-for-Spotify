The goal of this project is to bring people together through shared
interest in music. Using the Python Spotify API, the software will
sift through two Spotify users' libraries and create a list of 
artists/albums/songs/etc that the two users both listen to.

The output of the program may be a simple list of shared genres/artists/etc,
a playlist synthesized from the shared interests,

1. Get access to user accounts
2. Pull library data, store into an object
3. Find similar elements
4. Produce list of similar elements


Also: my entire team bailed on the day of the code jam, so this was very much
a growing experience for me.
